# Programming Familiarization Pt.3 for ROS2

## System requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS2 Humble

## General setup

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ros-humble-apriltag ros-humble-apriltag-ros
```

Note that `hector_trajectory_server` has **not** been ported to ROS2, so I simply wrote a replacement.

## Running

From the repo root:

```bash
$ colcon build
$ . install/setup.bash
$ ros2 launch motion_decoder_camera_moving.launch.py # or one of the other three launch files
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
ros2 bag play src/motion_decoder/bags/AprilTag_Moving/
```

And in a third terminal:

```bash
$ rviz2
```
